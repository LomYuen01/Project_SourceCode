The purpose of this code is to develop an in-store food ordering website. The goal of this project   
is to address the shortcomings of Reno's Kitchen's current business operations and enhance them      
through the implementation of this website. By utilizing this platform, we aim to boost efficiency  
and productivity by streamlining various processes through automation.                               

(  Please note that this website is still undergoing testing and is not yet officially complete  )
